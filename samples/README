This directory contains a variety of samples to help you understand MBOL syntax along with the different ways to use MBOL.

Setup CPLEX_HOME and MBOL_HOME environment variables before attempting to run these samples!

You can view the pdfs of the programs in mbol-source:
evince pdfs/*.pdf

Just make will create a main binary from main.cpp, create pdfs for all of the programs in mbol-source, and create a file I/O binary example for Maxflow:
make

You can try running the main binary created which runs all a version of all programs in mbol-source. Note that the graph theory algorithms are un on the graph in graph.pdf:
./main

You can try running the file I/O binary which reads in the *.var files to get input and will output *.var files that are program outputs:
cd maxflow
./MaxFlow

With gnuplot you can see the data which the SVM optimization program was applied to along with the resulting hypeplane:
make svm
evince *eps
