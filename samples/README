This directory contains a variety of samples to help you understand MBOL syntax along with the different ways to use MBOL. See the README directions in the root directory first to compile mbolc and setup environment parameters.

The directory mbol-source constains several sample programs written in MBOL.

Just make will create a main binary from main.cpp and a file I/O binary example for Maxflow:
make

You can create pdfs for all programs and view them with:
make pdfs
evince pdfs/*.pdf

You can try running the main binary created which runs all a version of all programs in mbol-source. Note that the graph theory algorithms are un on the graph in graph.pdf:
./main

You can try running the file I/O binary which reads in the *.var files to get input and will output *.var files that are program outputs:
cd maxflow
./MaxFlow

With gnuplot you can see the data which the SVM optimization program was applied to along with the resulting hypeplane:
make svm
evince *eps

CPLEX users can uncomment the two commented lines in the Makefile and replace the lines just above to compile these examples to work with CPLEX. The default compiles for COIN-OR's symphony solver.
